    "Early criminological work and national surveillance data suggest that homicide is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with many studies reporting higher rates during warmer months. A data collection from the Bureau of Justice Statistics<a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_ref-1) found that violent crime tends to increase in the summer, often attributed to greater outdoor activity, increased social interaction, and higher ambient temperatures, which possibly elevates aggression and opportunity for conflict, although the difference is quite small (about 4%). \n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related project “Crime Seasonality Analysis”<a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_ref-2) from GitHub investigates whether crime exhibits predictable seasonal structure by treating crime counts as a time series. The data was sourced from NYC Open Data<a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_ref-3) and the City of Chicago data portal<a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_ref-4). Methodologically, the project’s pipeline is similar to our project question. The author grouped crime incidents by month and created graphs to see if some months consistently had higher crime than others. Similarly to the data collection from BJS, their result showed that crime is not evenly spread across the year. They also noted that some types of crime show clearer seasonal patterns than others. An important takeaway we noticed was that patterns from New York City and Chicago are not universal — combined data from both cities yielded more ambiguous results than data analyzed separately, which is also a common statistical phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox<a name=\"cite_note-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_ref-5). From this, we will take into consideration that crime seasonality is fluid and depends on location/time period, rather than following one fixed national pattern, and that any potential pattern we find is likely not permanent. Thus, we will also test whether homicide patterns change over time. \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",

    "The data was obtained from a publicly available dataset hosted on Github, through a FOIA request from the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS). The data is anonymous and examined for analytical purposes, with no attempts to identify individuals. To further reduce privacy risks and avoid sensitive cases, the dataset excludes deaths where the age is under one and a half years old, records with missing birth or death dates, and dates falling on February 29 (leap years). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the obvious sensitive nature of mortality and homicide data, the analysis should be conducted carefully to avoid misleading interpretations or sensationalism. Although we intend to focus on seasonal patterns, there may be more personal details that end up being relevant, such as age, sex, marital status, and manner of death.  The concern for location privacy is mitigated, as there are no indicators of location (such as ZIP codes) beyond knowing that the data is measured from the Massachusetts population. \n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
