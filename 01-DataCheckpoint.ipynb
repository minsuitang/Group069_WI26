    "Early criminological work and national surveillance data suggest that homicide is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with many studies reporting higher rates during warmer months. A data collection from the Bureau of Justice Statistics1 found that violent crime tends to increase in the summer, often attributed to greater outdoor activity, increased social interaction, and higher ambient temperatures, which possibly elevates aggression and opportunity for conflict, although the difference is quite small (about 4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related project “Crime Seasonality Analysis”2 from GitHub investigates whether crime exhibits predictable seasonal structure by treating crime counts as a time series. The data was sourced from NYC Open Data3 and the City of Chicago data portal4. Methodologically, the project’s pipeline is similar to our project question. The author grouped crime incidents by month and created graphs to see if some months consistently had higher crime than others. Similarly to the data collection from BJS, their result showed that crime is not evenly spread across the year. They also noted that some types of crime show clearer seasonal patterns than others. An important takeaway we noticed was that patterns from New York City and Chicago are not universal — combined data from both cities yielded more ambiguous results than data analyzed separately, which is also a common statistical phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox5. From this, we will take into consideration that crime seasonality is fluid and depends on location/time period, rather than following one fixed national pattern, and that any potential pattern we find is likely not permanent. Thus, we will also test whether homicide patterns change over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset contains approximately 1.96 million individual mortality records. Each row represents one person’s recorded death, along with their birth date and several demographic attributes. A key variable we will be examining, days_from_birthday, measures how many days before or after a person’s birthday their death occurred. This allows us to examine whether deaths cluster around birthdays, which is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the “birthday effect.” We will use this term moving forward for ease of clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Variables and Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* birth (date): The individual’s date of birth. Stored initially as a string but convertible to datetime format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* death (date): The individual’s date of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "* age_floor (integer, years): The age at death, rounded down to the nearest whole year. Units are years. Typical human lifespan ranges from 0 to roughly 110–120 years. Values outside this range may indicate data errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* days_from_birthday (integer, days): The number of days between the individual’s birthday and their death. Units are days. A value of 0 means the person died on their birthday. Values typically range from -182 to +182 (approximately half a year before or after the birthday), though the dataset contains 365 unique values reflecting all possible calendar-day distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* sex (categorical): Biological sex category.\n",
    "\n",
    "* marital (categorical): Marital status at time of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "* manner (categorical): Manner of death (e.g., natural, accident, suicide, homicide, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variable for birthday clustering analysis is days_from_birthday. If deaths are evenly distributed throughout the year, we would expect roughly uniform counts across values of this variable. Significant spikes near 0 could suggest a birthday effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Concerns and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this dataset consists of recorded mortality events, it reflects only individuals who have died and does not represent the living population. Additionally, the dataset may be limited geographically or temporally depending on its source, which may introduce sampling bias. Missing demographic values (such as marital status) may not be missing at random and certain age groups or manners of death may be more likely to have incomplete records. Finally, birth and death dates are stored as strings and must be converted to datetime format for proper analysis."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Records and Statistics for administrative purposes and released publicly through a FOIA request. Because this study uses anonymous data with no personally identifiable information, informed consent from individuals was not required for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential sources of bias include underreporting, differences in the classification of manners of death, and systemic factors that may affect which deaths are recorded as homicides. This dataset also only reflects deaths in Massachusetts, which may not represent other regions. These limits are acknowledged and our conclusions should be restricted to the studied population.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset contains no PII such as names, addresses, or identification numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Variables like age, sex, and marital status were used cautiously to check for potential disparities, and not to draw conclusions about any protected group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset is public and anonymized on Github, but our analysis on it is accessible only to project members and used solely for academic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our manipulated data will only be retained for the duration of the project. However, the raw dataset is public and controlled by another party.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analysis recognizes that homicide rates are influenced by complex social, economic, and environmental factors not expressed in the dataset. Interpretations avoid oversimplification and acknowledge that seasonal variation by itself cannot explain patterns of violence.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data cleaning steps, including the removal of records with missing info, exclusion of  infant deaths under 1.5 years old, and removal of February 29 entries might introduce bias by omitting certain cases. These decisions were put in place to ensure consistent (month) comparisons and are acknowledged as limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Only anonymous data is used. No individual cases are to be highlighted, and results should be aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All data processing and analysis steps are documented and should be reproducible, allowing for future retesting and correction of potential errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No model is used? The study is descriptive instead of predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The project communicates that findings show correlation, not causation, and are limited to the Massachusetts dataset and the analyzed timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This research is for academic purposes, but it would be interesting to keep monitoring with current data and different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No decisions affecting individuals were made based on this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To reduce risk of unintended use, results are presented carefully while emphasizing that seasonal patterns do not explain underlying causes of homicide and should not be used to support harmful narratives or policies.\n"
