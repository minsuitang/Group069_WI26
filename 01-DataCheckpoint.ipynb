    "Early criminological work and national surveillance data suggest that homicide is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with many studies reporting higher rates during warmer months. A data collection from the Bureau of Justice Statistics1 found that violent crime tends to increase in the summer, often attributed to greater outdoor activity, increased social interaction, and higher ambient temperatures, which possibly elevates aggression and opportunity for conflict, although the difference is quite small (about 4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related project “Crime Seasonality Analysis”2 from GitHub investigates whether crime exhibits predictable seasonal structure by treating crime counts as a time series. The data was sourced from NYC Open Data3 and the City of Chicago data portal4. Methodologically, the project’s pipeline is similar to our project question. The author grouped crime incidents by month and created graphs to see if some months consistently had higher crime than others. Similarly to the data collection from BJS, their result showed that crime is not evenly spread across the year. They also noted that some types of crime show clearer seasonal patterns than others. An important takeaway we noticed was that patterns from New York City and Chicago are not universal — combined data from both cities yielded more ambiguous results than data analyzed separately, which is also a common statistical phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox5. From this, we will take into consideration that crime seasonality is fluid and depends on location/time period, rather than following one fixed national pattern, and that any potential pattern we find is likely not permanent. Thus, we will also test whether homicide patterns change over time.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",

    "The data was obtained from a publicly available dataset hosted on Github, through a FOIA request from the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS). The data is anonymous and examined for analytical purposes, with no attempts to identify individuals. To further reduce privacy risks and avoid sensitive cases, the dataset excludes deaths where the age is under one and a half years old, records with missing birth or death dates, and dates falling on February 29 (leap years). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the obvious sensitive nature of mortality and homicide data, the analysis should be conducted carefully to avoid misleading interpretations or sensationalism. Although we intend to focus on seasonal patterns, there may be more personal details that end up being relevant, such as age, sex, marital status, and manner of death.  The concern for location privacy is mitigated, as there are no indicators of location (such as ZIP codes) beyond knowing that the data is measured from the Massachusetts population. \n",

    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
