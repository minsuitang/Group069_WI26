    "Early criminological work and national surveillance data suggest that homicide is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with many studies reporting higher rates during warmer months. A data collection from the Bureau of Justice Statistics1 found that violent crime tends to increase in the summer, often attributed to greater outdoor activity, increased social interaction, and higher ambient temperatures, which possibly elevates aggression and opportunity for conflict, although the difference is quite small (about 4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related project “Crime Seasonality Analysis”2 from GitHub investigates whether crime exhibits predictable seasonal structure by treating crime counts as a time series. The data was sourced from NYC Open Data3 and the City of Chicago data portal4. Methodologically, the project’s pipeline is similar to our project question. The author grouped crime incidents by month and created graphs to see if some months consistently had higher crime than others. Similarly to the data collection from BJS, their result showed that crime is not evenly spread across the year. They also noted that some types of crime show clearer seasonal patterns than others. An important takeaway we noticed was that patterns from New York City and Chicago are not universal — combined data from both cities yielded more ambiguous results than data analyzed separately, which is also a common statistical phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox5. From this, we will take into consideration that crime seasonality is fluid and depends on location/time period, rather than following one fixed national pattern, and that any potential pattern we find is likely not permanent. Thus, we will also test whether homicide patterns change over time.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.
